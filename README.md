To run the app on your machine, locally or on docker, fiddle around with your own database.
For obvious reasons i don't include passwords.
You can either include your config files for your db or set variables in command line for docker.

Also keep keep in mind that there is 2 different node_modules for the server and the client.

For each, do:
npm i
